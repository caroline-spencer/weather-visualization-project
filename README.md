# RDU Weather Data Visualization Project

As an exploratory project to compare different data visualization tools, I created multiple visualizations with historical weather data (1944-2025) from Raleigh Durham International Airport to look at temperature and precipitation trends over time. This data was sourced from publicly available datasets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration within the National Centers for Environmental Information (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/past-weather/Raleigh-Durham%20International%20Airport).

The data visualization tools included in this project are SAS, Tableau, Observable Plot (JavaScript), and Python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy).
