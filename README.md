# Weather Data Visualization Project

I created data visualizations with historical weather data sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration within the National Centers for Environmental Information. I used historical weather data from Raleigh Durham International Airport (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/past-weather/Raleigh-Durham%20International%20Airport) to look at temperature and precipitation trends over time.

This was an exploratory project to compare different data visualization tools in terms of capabilities, data preparation, and visual appearance.
