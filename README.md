# Weather Data Visualization Project

I created data visualizations with historical weather data from Raleigh Durham International Airport (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/past-weather/Raleigh-Durham%20International%20Airport) to look at temperature and precipitation trends over time. This data was sourced from publicly available datasets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration within the National Centers for Environmental Information. 

This was an exploratory project to compare different data visualization tools in terms of capabilities, data preparation, and visual appearance.
