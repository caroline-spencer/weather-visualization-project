# Weather Data Visualization Project

As an exploratory project to compare different data visualization tools in terms of capabilities, data preparation, and visual appearance, I created data visualizations with historical weather data from Raleigh Durham International Airport  to look at temperature and precipitation trends over time. This data was sourced from publicly available datasets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration within the National Centers for Environmental Information (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/past-weather/Raleigh-Durham%20International%20Airport).
